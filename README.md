**Age Calculator:**
To create an Age Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can start by designing a user interface that includes input fields for the birthdate and a button to calculate the age. Use CSS to style the elements and make the calculator visually appealing. In JavaScript, write functions to calculate the age based on the inputted birthdate and the current date. You can use Date objects to handle the date calculations efficiently. Implement logic to validate the input, calculate the age accurately, and display the result dynamically on the webpage. Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs to enhance user experience. Test your Age Calculator thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate results.

**To-Do List:**
For creating a To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, begin by designing a layout that includes input fields for adding tasks, a list to display tasks, and buttons to mark tasks as completed or remove them. Style your elements using CSS to make the To-Do List visually appealing and user-friendly. In JavaScript, write functions to add tasks to the list, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks when needed. Utilize local storage to save tasks so that they persist even after the page is refreshed. Implement event listeners to trigger these functions based on user interactions like button clicks or key presses. Test your To-Do List thoroughly to ensure smooth functionality and a seamless user experience. Consider adding features like task prioritization or due dates to enhance the usability of your To-Do List application.
